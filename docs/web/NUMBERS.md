# Decision-number allocation ledger

**Admin owns this file.** A lane does not pick its own numbers.

## Why this exists

Six numbering collisions happened before this file did. Every one had the same
shape: two lanes appending to the same numbered list at the same time, each
reading a table that was correct when it read it. GP-25 twice, ARCHITECTURE
items 108/109, FS-33/FS-34, GP-57 to GP-60 four ways, and finally a case where
one lane claimed GP-65 to GP-72, committed first, was renumbered around by a
second lane, and the second lane then landed on the renumbered range anyway.

Conventions did not fix it, because the failure is a race and a convention is
not a lock. Reviewing harder did not fix it either. The only thing that works
is that the numbers are handed out by one writer before the work starts.

## The rule

1. Admin allocates a **disjoint block** to each lane **in its brief**, before
   the lane begins.
2. A lane uses only its own block. It never reads the table to decide what is
   free, because that read is the race.
3. A lane that runs out asks Admin for another block rather than taking the
   next number it can see.
4. Unused numbers in a block are **abandoned, not reclaimed**. A gap in the
   sequence costs nothing. Reusing a number costs a day of confusion, and has.
5. Admin updates this file when it allocates, not when the lane lands. An
   allocation that exists only in a brief is invisible to the next allocation.

## Allocated

| Block | Lane | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GP-57 to GP-60 | launch pad placement | landed |
| GP-61 to GP-64 | machine interaction panel | landed |
| GP-65 | combat, health on every buildable | landed |
| GP-66 to GP-72 | combat, claimed then abandoned in a collision | **burned, never reuse** |
| GP-73 to GP-76 | launch pad, clamp and recover and stairs | landed |
| GP-77 to GP-78 | unused remainder of the pad block | burned |
| GP-79, GP-82 | combat, player health and sandbox danger rule | landed |
| GP-80, GP-81, GP-83, GP-84 | combat, claimed and unstarted | held |
| GP-85 to GP-99 | combat continuation: the gun, enemies in the world | allocated |
| GP-100 to GP-114 | Escape menu and cheat panel | allocated, not started |
| GP-115 to GP-129 | VAB overhaul | GP-115 to GP-122 USED (snap near misses, the radial pylon, the probe vite config, the pre-flight verdict, the roll-out confirm, the tabbed rail, recover in the bay, the bay camera); GP-123 onward free |
| WG-29 to WG-30 | the map draws the world | landed |
| WG-31 to WG-32 | tunnel floor, tunnel mouth | landed |
| WG-33 to WG-34 | close-in map contrast, ABI 14 | landed |
| WG-35 to WG-44 | water: the pond basin, the water level authority, ABI 16, swimming | landed (WG-35 blob diagnosis, WG-36 basin + water_field.h, WG-37 water_field_tests, WG-38 ABI 16, WG-39 WaterOracle, WG-40 Swim.ts, WG-41 Capsule/slopeGate split, WG-42 WaterSurface, WG-43 pondwade probe, WG-44 pondshot probe) |
| WG-45 to WG-49 | water remainder: the pump and pipes are NOT in this block, they need an Admin decision first | held |
| PH-45 to PH-46 | tunnel sinking does not reproduce under a mountain | landed |
| PH-47 to PH-59 | tunnel sinking, structural lead | allocated |
| FS-33, FS-35 to FS-42 | corner cargo, pollution, typed items, belt corners | landed |
| FS-43 to FS-57 | Satisfactory-style machine ports | allocated, not started |
| GP-85, GP-86 | combat: enemy loop at ABI 15, the gun | landed |
| GP-87 to GP-99 | combat remainder, enemies in the world | held |
| RN-1 to RN-14 | rendering, historic | landed |
| RN-15 to RN-29 | ground vegetation, contact blending, aerial perspective | allocated |
| FS-56 to FS-75 | assemblers, storage container, machine scale | allocated |
| PH-64 to PH-84 | vessel persistence and on-rails propagation | PH-64 to PH-70 USED (the registry as the one answer to "where is this vessel", the three record modes, ABI 18, the saved form, the player's body parks coherently, the handoff seam, the verified design snapshot); PH-71 onward free |
| RN-45 to RN-69 | graphics pass three: rocks, LOD2 cards, terrain material | allocated |
| GP-100 to GP-114 | Escape menu, cheats, hotbar editing, BUILD MENU on B | allocated |
| RN-30 to RN-44 | rendering: shadow contact, grass height, aerial perspective take two | allocated |
| PH-47 | tunnel sinking, structural lead, not reproduced | landed |
| PH-60 to PH-74 | physics: R18 fall through rock, R18b stuck in a wall | landed at PH-60 to PH-63. **THE TAIL OF THIS ROW OVERLAPS `PH-64 to PH-84` ABOVE AND IS SURRENDERED**: the later allocation is the live one, PH-64 to PH-70 are the vessel lane's, and nothing from the R18 lane may take a number above PH-63. Recorded rather than silently renumbered, because two lanes reading the same row differently is how a number gets used twice |
| BT-27 | the build stamp | landed |

FS-34 is deliberately unused: the pollution lane renumbered its own FS-33/FS-34
to FS-35/FS-36 when corner cargo reached main first.

## Related

Standing rule 10 (path-limited commits) is the other half of this. Two lanes in
one checkout collide on files as well as on numbers, and a broad `git add` has
already swept one lane's work into another lane's commit.

## FIRST: `git commit -- <paths>` DISCARDS YOUR INDEX

Read this before the technique below, because it is the trap the technique
exists to escape, and standing rule 10 as originally written walked straight
into it.

**`git commit -- <paths>` does not commit what you staged.** It ignores the
index and commits the CURRENT WORKING TREE contents of those paths. So a lane
that hunk-stages carefully, verifies with `git diff --cached --numstat`, and
then commits "path-limited" has its hunk selection **silently thrown away** and
ships whole files including other lanes' in-flight edits.

That is the mechanism behind all three incidents this session where one lane's
work landed inside another lane's commit. It was never carelessness. Three
lanes followed the rule as written and the rule was wrong.

- `git add <paths>` then a bare `git commit` (no pathspec) is safe: it commits
  the index.
- `git commit -- <paths>` is NOT safe and must not be used when any file you
  touch also carries someone else's uncommitted work.

## Committing from a shared checkout without disturbing other lanes

Standing rule 10 says commit path-limited. That is necessary and it is not
sufficient: `git add <paths>` still writes the SHARED index, so a lane that
stages 32 files and a lane that stages 3 fight over one file, and three times
this project a broad `git add` swept another lane's work into the wrong commit.

The Escape-menu lane solved it properly on 2026-07-28 and it is now the
recommended technique when other lanes have staged work:

1. Point `GIT_INDEX_FILE` at a private index file.
2. Stage only your paths into it.
3. `git commit-tree` and `git update-ref` to land the commit.

The shared index is never touched, so a lane with a large staged set keeps it.

When a file you own carries ANOTHER lane's uncommitted hunks in the working
tree, do not commit the file wholesale. Build a **filtered blob** from `HEAD`
plus your own hunks and stage that. Their work stays in the working tree for
them to commit themselves.

This is the difference between "I tried not to touch their work" and "I could
not have touched their work". Prefer the second.

One wrinkle the private-index technique does not remove: after landing a commit
that way, the SHARED index still holds pre-commit entries for your paths and
will read as staged modifications or deletions. Follow with
`git reset -q HEAD -- <your paths>` (scoped to your paths, never `.`).

### Freezing a build: archive `web`, never the whole tree

`git archive HEAD | tar -x` extracts **`ue/` as well**, which is 6.8 GB of dead
Unreal assets superseded by the Three.js pivot. Two lanes doing that at once
filled a 931 GB disk to zero on 2026-07-28 and briefly stopped every lane.

Always scope it:

```
git archive HEAD web | tar -x --strip-components=1 -C <dir>
```

Then `cp -r web/public <dir>/public` (generated, not tracked) and build with
`OF_BUILD_STAMP=<sha>` so the frozen bundle states the commit it came from
rather than interrogating the checkout around it.

Delete the scratch directory when done. A 24 MB build left behind is nothing;
thirteen of them plus their Chrome profiles is not.
