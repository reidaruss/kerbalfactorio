# Decision-number allocation ledger

**Admin owns this file.** A lane does not pick its own numbers.

## Why this exists

Six numbering collisions happened before this file did. Every one had the same
shape: two lanes appending to the same numbered list at the same time, each
reading a table that was correct when it read it. GP-25 twice, ARCHITECTURE
items 108/109, FS-33/FS-34, GP-57 to GP-60 four ways, and finally a case where
one lane claimed GP-65 to GP-72, committed first, was renumbered around by a
second lane, and the second lane then landed on the renumbered range anyway.

Conventions did not fix it, because the failure is a race and a convention is
not a lock. Reviewing harder did not fix it either. The only thing that works
is that the numbers are handed out by one writer before the work starts.

## The rule

1. Admin allocates a **disjoint block** to each lane **in its brief**, before
   the lane begins.
2. A lane uses only its own block. It never reads the table to decide what is
   free, because that read is the race.
3. A lane that runs out asks Admin for another block rather than taking the
   next number it can see.
4. Unused numbers in a block are **abandoned, not reclaimed**. A gap in the
   sequence costs nothing. Reusing a number costs a day of confusion, and has.
5. Admin updates this file when it allocates, not when the lane lands. An
   allocation that exists only in a brief is invisible to the next allocation.

## Allocated

| Block | Lane | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GP-57 to GP-60 | launch pad placement | landed |
| GP-61 to GP-64 | machine interaction panel | landed |
| GP-65 | combat, health on every buildable | landed |
| GP-66 to GP-72 | combat, claimed then abandoned in a collision | **burned, never reuse** |
| GP-73 to GP-76 | launch pad, clamp and recover and stairs | landed |
| GP-77 to GP-78 | unused remainder of the pad block | burned |
| GP-79, GP-82 | combat, player health and sandbox danger rule | landed |
| GP-80, GP-81, GP-83, GP-84 | combat, claimed and unstarted | held |
| GP-85 to GP-99 | combat continuation: the gun, enemies in the world | allocated |
| GP-100 to GP-114 | Escape menu and cheat panel | allocated, not started |
| GP-115 to GP-129 | VAB overhaul | GP-115 to GP-122 USED (snap near misses, the radial pylon, the probe vite config, the pre-flight verdict, the roll-out confirm, the tabbed rail, recover in the bay, the bay camera); GP-123 onward free |
| WG-29 to WG-30 | the map draws the world | landed |
| WG-31 to WG-32 | tunnel floor, tunnel mouth | landed |
| WG-33 to WG-34 | close-in map contrast, ABI 14 | landed |
| WG-35 to WG-49 | water: basin, pond, swimming | allocated, not started |
| PH-45 to PH-46 | tunnel sinking does not reproduce under a mountain | landed |
| PH-47 to PH-59 | tunnel sinking, structural lead | allocated |
| FS-33, FS-35 to FS-42 | corner cargo, pollution, typed items, belt corners | landed |
| FS-43 to FS-57 | Satisfactory-style machine ports | allocated, not started |
| GP-85, GP-86 | combat: enemy loop at ABI 15, the gun | landed |
| GP-87 to GP-99 | combat remainder, enemies in the world | held |
| RN-1 to RN-14 | rendering, historic | landed |
| RN-15 to RN-29 | ground vegetation, contact blending, aerial perspective | allocated |
| RN-30 to RN-44 | rendering: shadow contact, grass height, aerial perspective take two | allocated |
| PH-47 | tunnel sinking, structural lead, not reproduced | landed |
| PH-60 to PH-74 | physics: R18 fall through rock, R18b stuck in a wall | allocated |
| BT-27 | the build stamp | landed |

FS-34 is deliberately unused: the pollution lane renumbered its own FS-33/FS-34
to FS-35/FS-36 when corner cargo reached main first.

Standing rule 10 (path-limited commits) is the other half of this. Two lanes in
one checkout collide on files as well as on numbers, and a broad `git add` has
already swept one lane's work into another lane's commit.
