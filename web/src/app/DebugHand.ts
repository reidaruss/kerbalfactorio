// WHAT A KEY PRESS REACHES: the number keys, the wheel and Escape (GP-1075,
// split out of DebugGameplay.ts under the 400-line cap).
//
// The five entries here are one concern and it is the header rule of the file
// they came from: every one goes through the player's own handler. `build` and
// `hotbar` are the number keys, `assignSlot` is the drag a player makes in the
// pack, and `escape` plays a real input tape into `Input` rather than calling
// a close method. `modals` belongs with them because it is the DERIVED list
// that press is asserted against.
